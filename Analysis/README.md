## Analysis

**Disclaimer** No results are shown in this folder. I only present here the idea of doing spatio-temporal modeling using deep learning. Basically, we use the number of patients of one region 
as a feature to predict the number of patients in the neighboring region. The process of including the spatial information fo the patients is done several time steps ago. In addition, we add 
the search activity of a particular keyword related to the disease as an inpu to forecast outbreaks. This data is provided by [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US).
